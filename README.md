## 📄 Overview

This project is a small Android app that loads a list of invoices and allows users to filter them by status, date range, and amount.  
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate modern Android development practices (MVVM, separation of concerns, repository pattern) and a production-like structure suitable for a professional environment or portfolio.

## 🖼️ Visual Showcase

The showcase highlights the core flow:

1. Main screen with data source selection (Retrofit vs Retromock).  
2. Invoice list screen with loaded data.  
3. Filter panel with statuses, date range, and amount range.

## 💡 Features

- **Smart Loading:** Skeleton shimmer animation provides immediate visual feedback during data fetching.
- **Robust Filtering:** Filter by status, date range (using modern `MaterialDatePicker`), and amount.
- **State Management:**
  -  **Loading:** Shimmer effect.
  -  **Success:** RecyclerView list.
  -  **Empty:** Custom illustration and helpful text when no results are found.
  -  **Error:** Retry mechanism for network failures.
- **Dual Data Source:** Toggle between **Real API (Retrofit)** and **Mock Data (Retromock)** instantly.
- **Modern UI:** Material Design 3 components, rounded corners, and edge-to-edge support.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The project follows a layered design with a focus on clarity, testability, and maintainability.

### Presentation Layer (UI + ViewModel)

- Pattern: **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)**.  
- Responsibilities:
  - UI logic and state management.  
  - Observing `LiveData` and updating views.  
- Main components:
  - `MainActivity`: entry point, navigation to the invoice list, and toggle between Retrofit and Retromock.  
  - `InvoiceListActivity`: displays the invoice list, observes `LiveData<List<Invoice>>`, and integrates filtering.  
  - `FilterFragment`: panel to select filter criteria (status, dates, amount).  

### Domain Layer (Use Case)

- `GetInvoicesUseCase`:
  - Encapsulates the logic to request invoices from the repository.  
  - Hides the details of whether data comes from a real API or mocked responses.  

### Data Layer (Repository + API Clients)

- `InvoiceRepository`:
  - Implements the Repository pattern to abstract data sources.  
  - Decides whether to use Retrofit or Retromock based on a flag (`useMock`).  
- `ApiService` + `RetroFitClient`:
  - Handle real HTTP requests to the remote API.  
- `RetromockClient`:
  - Provides mocked responses for local development, demos, or offline use.  

This structure helps keep the code decoupled, easier to evolve, and prepared for unit testing.

## 💾 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Giraffe or newer recommended).  
- JDK 8 or higher (managed by Android Studio).  
- Android device or emulator with a recent Android version.  

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**

- Choose “Open an Existing Project”.  
- Select the project folder.  

3. **Sync Gradle and build:**

- Android Studio will automatically download dependencies.  
- Wait until the sync and initial build finishes.

## 💾 Download / Release

You can download the latest APK of **InvoiceApp** from the releases section:

- **Version:** v1.0.0 – Initial Demo Release  
- **Download:** [app-release.apk](https://github.com/pach24/InvoiceApp/releases/download/v1.0.0/app-release.apk)

> ⚠️ Make sure to allow installation from **unknown sources** on your Android device before installing.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Flow

1. **Launch the app** to open `MainActivity`.  
2. **Toggle data source**:
- Use the toggle button to switch between **Retrofit (real API)** and **Retromock (mock data)**.  
- The current mode is passed to the next screen via an intent extra (`USERETROMOCK`).  
3. **Open the invoice list**:
- Tap the button to navigate to `InvoiceListActivity`.  
- The app loads invoices through `InvoiceViewModel` → `GetInvoicesUseCase` → `InvoiceRepository`.  

### Filtering Invoices

1. In the invoice list, open the filter panel from the toolbar/menu.  
2. In `FilterFragment`, configure:
- **Status** checkboxes (paid, pending payment, cancelled, fixed fee, payment plan…).  
- **Date range** using the “from” and “until” buttons (date pickers).  
- **Amount range** using the `RangeSlider` (min and max).  
3. Tap **Apply**:
- The fragment sends the filter data back to `InvoiceListActivity` via a `Bundle`.  
- The activity applies the filters and updates the list if there are results.  
4. Optionally, tap **Reset** in the filter panel to restore default values (status, dates, and slider).

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- The benefits of **decoupled architecture**: separating UI, domain, and data layers simplifies reasoning and refactoring.  
- Robust **UI state management** using `ViewModel` and `LiveData` improves resilience to configuration changes.  
- Designing for **multiple data sources** (Retrofit vs Retromock) encourages clean abstractions and easier testing.  
- Structuring code with future testing in mind makes it easier to gradually introduce unit tests for ViewModels and use cases.
